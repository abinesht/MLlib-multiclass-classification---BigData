Ray Charles,Georgia on My Mind,1960,soul,"Georgia, Georgia 
The whole day through (the whole day through) 
Just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind) 
I said Georgia 
Georgia 
A song of you (a song of you) 
Comes as sweet and clear 
As moonlight through the pines 
Other arms reach out to me 
Other eyes smile tenderly 
Still in peaceful dreams I see 
The road leads back to you 
I said Georgia 
Oh Georgia, no peace I find (no peace I find) 
Just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind) 
Other arms reach out to me 
Other eyes smile tenderly 
Still in peaceful dreams I see 
The road leads back to you 
Whoa-whoa, Georgia 
Georgia 
No peace, no peace I find 
Just an old, sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind) 
I said just an old sweet song 
Keeps Georgia on my mind"
Otis Redding,(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,1967,soul,"Sittin' in the mornin' sun 
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes 
Watching the ships roll in 
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah 
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh 
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Wastin' time 
I left my home in Georgia 
Headed for the Frisco Bay 
'Cause I've had nothin' to live for 
It look like nothin's gonna come my way 
So I'm just gon' sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh 
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time 
Look like nothin's gonna change 
Everything still remains the same 
I can't do what ten people tell me to do 
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes 
Sittin' here restin' my bones 
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen 
Two thousand miles, I roam 
Just to make this dock my home 
Now I'm just gon' sit, at the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh yeah 
Sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Wastin' time"

Stevie Wonder,Superstition,1972,soul,"Very superstitious, 
Writing's on the wall, 
Very superstitious, 
Ladders bout' to fall, 
Thirteen month old baby, 
Broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck,

Wash your face and hands, 
Rid me of the problem, 
Do all that you can, 
Keep me in a daydream, 
Keep me goin' strong, 
You don't wanna save me, 
Sad is the soul

That you don't understand, 
Then you suffer, 
Superstition ain't the way, 
Yeh, yeh

Curtis Mayfield,People Get Ready,1965,soul,"People get ready 
There's a train a-coming 
You don't need no baggage 
You just get on board 
All you need is faith 
To hear the diesels humming 
Don't need no ticket 
You just thank the Lord 
So people get ready 
For the train to Jordan 
Picking up passengers' coast to coast 
Faith is the key 
Open the doors and board 'em 
There's hope for all 
Among those loved the most 
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner 
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own (believe me now) 
Have pity on those 
Whose chances grow thinner 
For there's no hiding place against the Kingdom's Throne 
So people get ready 
There's a train a-comin' 
You don't need no baggage 
You just get on board 
All you need is faith 
To hear the diesels humming 
Don't need no ticket 
You just thank the Lord"
The Temptations,My Girl,1964,soul,"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day

What can make me feel this way 
My girl, my girl, my girl 
Talkin' 'bout my girl 
My girl 
I've got so much honey 
The bees envy me 
I've got a sweeter song 
Than the birds in the trees 
Well, I guess you'd say 
What can make me feel this way 
My girl, my girl, my girl 
Talkin' 'bout my girl 
My girl 
Ohh ohh 
Hey hey hey

I've got all the riches baby one man can claim

What can make me feel this way 
My girl, my girl, my girl 
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl, talkin' 'bout my girl

The Four Tops,Reach Out I'll Be There,1966,soul,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone 
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion 
And your world around is crumblin' down 
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach on out for me 
Reach out, reach out for me 
I'll be there, with a love that will shelter you 
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough 
And you feel the world has grown cold 
And you're drifting out all on your own 
And you need a hand to hold 
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me 
Reach out, reach out for me 
I'll be there, to love and comfort you 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you 
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through 
I'll be there to love and comfort you 
I can tell the way you hang your head 
You're without love and now you're afraid 
And through your tears you look around 
But there's no peace of mind to be found 
I know what you're thinkin' 
You're alone now, no love of your own 
But darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me 
Reach out 
Just look over your shoulder 
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me 
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need 
I'll be there, you can always depend on me

Sam Cooke,A Change Is Gonna Come,1964,soul,"I was born by the river 
In a little tent 
Oh, and just like the river, I've been running 
Ever since 
It's been a long 
A long time coming, but I know 
A change gon' come 
Oh yes, it will 
It's been too hard living 
But I'm afraid to die 
'Cause I don't know what's up there 
Beyond the sky 
It's been a long 
A long time coming, but I know 
A change gon' come 
Oh yes, it will 
I go to the movie 
And I go downtown 
And somebody keep telling me 
""Don't hang around"" 
It's been a long 
A long time coming, but I know 
A change gon' come 
Oh yes, it will 
Then, I go to my brother 
And I say, ""Brother, help me, please"" 
But he winds up knockin' me 
Back down on my knees, oh 
There been times that I thought 
I couldn't last for long 
But now, I think I'm able 
To carry on 
It's been a long 
A long time coming, but I know 
A change gon' come 
Oh yes, it will"

Living in darkness to hide our wrong 
You and me 
At the dark end 
Of the street 
You and me 
I know time is gonna take its toll 
We have to pay for the love we stole

Oh yeah, uh, oh yeah 
This is an old Memphis song, old Memphis song 
I used to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day 
It was the hardest thing to put them away 
I'd drink four or five bottles of wine 
I kept a glass in my hand all the time 
Breaking those habits was hard to do 
But nothing compared to the changes that you put me through 
Tryin' to live my life without you, babe 
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do 
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared, yeah 
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear 
All right 
Watch this 
I had the worst reputation in town 
For chasing all the women around 
I thought changing my way of living was hard to do 
But it's nothing compared to the changes that you put me through 
I've done everything I've tried to do 
But it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you 
Tryin' to live my life without you, babe 
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do 
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared, yeah 
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear 
Silver bullet 
Ooh, yeah 
Tryin' to live my life without you, babe 
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do 
Tryin' to forget the love we shared 
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear

Bettye LaVette,Let Me Down Easy,1962,soul,"There's a little moonlight dancin' on the sand 
There's a warm breeze blowin' by the ocean as you're takin' my hand 
You need to know, where I'm standin' now 
That I'm right on the edge of givin' into ya 
Baby, it's a long way down 
If I fall, can you let me down easy 
If I leave my heart with you tonight will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right 
I'm barely hangin' on 
If I fall, can you let me down easy 
The scent of your perfume floatin' in the air 
Lookin' like an angel layin' on a blanket with a halo of hair 
And those lips, they're too good to be true 
Once I taste that kiss I know what'll happen 
I'll be at the mercy of you 
If I fall, can you let me down easy 
If I leave my heart with you tonight will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right 
I'm barely hangin' on

The Crystals,Then He Kissed Me,1962,soul,"Well, he walked up to me and he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kinda nice and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home to meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

""Mmm-hmm""
""Gee, it must be great riding with him""

""Mmm-mmm""
""By the way, where did you meet him?""
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture
""Yes, we see""
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack
My folks were always putting him down (down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(What you mean when you say that he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad, but I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack
One day, my dad said, ""find someone new""
I had to tell my Jimmy, ""we're through""
(What you mean when you say that you better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack
He sort of smiled, then kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard
I'll never know (know, know, know, know, know, know, know)
Look out, look out, look out
I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
In school, they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack

Percy Sledge,When a Man Loves a Woman,1966,soul,"When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else

For the good thing he's found 
If she is bad, he can't see it 
She can do no wrong 
And turn his back on his best friend 
If he puts her down 
When a man loves a woman 
Spend his very last dime 
And trying to hold on to what he needs 
He'd give up all his comforts 
And sleep out in the rain 
If she said that's the way, it ought to be 
When a man loves a woman 
I give you everything I've got 
Trying to hold on to your precious love 
And baby baby please don't treat me bad 
When a man loves a woman 
Deep down in his soul 
She can bring him such misery 
If she is playing him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Loving eyes can never see 
Yes when a man loves a woman 
I know exactly how he feels

When a man loves a woman 
When a man loves a woman 
When a man loves a woman 
When a man, when a man

I've been out here so very long, I've lost all my direction 
Baby when you came my way I thought I'd found my protection 
But a strong wind came into my life, surely took me by surprise 
And I can't seem to control these tears that's falling from my eyes 
I've been down one time

I'm in the middle of a bad love storm, ew yeah I just can't let it boy I 
Looked around and all I could see, was water coming over me 
I've been down one time 
And I've been down two times 
But right now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love 
All I do is cry, all I do is walk around and cry 
But right now I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning in the sea of love 
I've been down one time 
I've been down two times 
But I can't control myself, I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love 
But that's alright, I don't mind drowning for your love 
That's alright baby, hear me when I say it's alright

Time, time waits for no one and I wish, how I wish someone would care 
Some folks think you're happy, when you wear your smile 
What about your tribulations, and all, all of your trials 
Smiles, smiles hide a lots a things 
The good, the bad, the hurt, all of this goes too

Tables turn and now her turn to cry 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Well, she used to run around with every man in town 
She spent all my money, playing her high class game 
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried 
Tables turn and now her turn to cry 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed 
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head 
But now she's here and there, with every man in town 
Still trying to take me for that same old clown 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

You better think about it twice 
While you're out cheating on your woman 
There's something you never even thought of, and that is 
Who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love (hear me now) 
Who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love 
I've seen so, so many fellows 
Fall in that same old bag 
Thinking that a woman is made to, 
To be beat on and treated so bad 
Oh, fellows, let me ask you something 
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of, 
Who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love 
Who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love 
I know there are some women gives the other excuse 
I'm not tryin' to run your life, boy it's up to you 
Oh, you oh, you, 
Reason why I ask this question 
I used to be the same old way 
When I decided to straighten up 
I found it was a bit too late 
Oh, that's when it all happened 
Something I never, never dreamed of 
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady 
While I was out making love 
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady 
While I was out making love 
Now who's making love to your old lady 
While you were out making love"

Tearin' it all apart

A rainy night in Georgia 
A rainy night in Georgia 
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world 
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world 
Neon signs a-flashin' 
Taxicabs and buses passin' through the night 
A distant moanin' of a train 
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night 
But it's a rainy night in Georgia 
Such a rainy night in Georgia 
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world 
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world 
How many times I wondered 
It still comes out the same 
No matter how you look at it or think of it 
It's life and you just got to play the game 
Find me a place in a box car 
So I take my guitar to pass some time 
Late at night when it's hard to rest 
I hold your picture to my chest and I feel fine, I feel fine 
But it's a rainy night in Georgia 
Baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia 
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world 
Kinda lonely now and it's rainin' all over the world

Lying on the floor when I break through 
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat

Come back, I still need you 
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right 
I swear to love you all my life

Long endless highway, you're silent beside me 
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from 
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading 
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones 
They took you away on a table 
I pace back and forth as you lay still 
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat 
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me 
Hold on, I still want you 
Come back, I still need you 
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right 
I swear to love you all my life 
Hold on, I still need you

'Cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you, babe 
Remember the day I set you free 
I told you you could always count on me, darling 
From that day on, I made a vow 
I'll be there when you want me 
Some way, somehow 
'Cause, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you, babe 
Oh no, darling 
No wind, no rain 
Or winter's cold can stop me, baby, na na, baby 
'Cause you are my goal 
If you're ever in trouble 
I'll be there on the double 
Just send for me, oh, baby, ha 
My love is alive (woo) 
Way down in my heart 
Although we are miles apart 
If you ever need a helping hand 
I'll be there on the double 
Just as fast as I can 
Don't you know that there 
Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough 
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you, babe 
Don'tcha know that there 
Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough 
Ain't no river wide enough 
Ain't no mountain high enough 
Ain't no valley low enough"

Donny Hathaway & Roberta Flack,The Closer I Get to You,1978,soul,"The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving me all you got 
Your love has captured me 
Over and over again 
I tried to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
And all the while inside I knew it was real 
The way you make me feel 
Lying here next to you 
Time just seems to fly 
Needing you more and more 
Let's give love a try (oh, oh, oh) 
Sweeter than sweeter love grows 
And heaven's there for those 
Who fool the tricks of time 
With the hearts of love they find true love 
In a special way 
The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving me all you got 
Your love has captured me 
Over and over again 
I try to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
And all the while inside I knew it was real 
The way you make me feel 
The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving you all I got

Isaac Hayes,Shaft,1971,soul,"Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?

You're damn right 
Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?

Can you dig it? 
Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about? 
(Shaft) 
Right on 
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother

But I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft

But no one understands him but his woman

Is the most he'll confess 
But the time's running out 
And there's no happiness

Prince,Purple Rain,1984,soul,"I never meant to cause you any sorrow

I only wanted to see you 
Laughing in the purple rain 
Purple rain, purple rain 
I only want to see you 
Laughing in the purple rain"
Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,1982,soul,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene 
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round? 
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene 
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
People always told me be careful of what you do 
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
And mother always told me be careful of who you love 
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
For forty days and forty nights 
The law was on her side 
But who can stand when she's in demand 
Her schemes and plans 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round 
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice 
(Do think twice, do think twice) 
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me 
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no) 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby 
People always told me be careful of what you do 
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
She came and stood right by me 
Just the smell of sweet perfume 
This happened much too soon 
She called me to her room 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe 
She says I am the one 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean) 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover"
Stevie Wonder,Sir Duke,1976,soul,"Music is a world within itself 
With a language we all understand 
With an equal opportunity 
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands 
But just because a record has a groove 
Don't make it in the groove 
But you can tell right away at letter A 
When the people start to move 
They can feel it all over 
But they can feel it all over people 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people, no, yeah 
Music knows that it is and always will 
Be one of the things that life just won't quit 
But here are some of music's pioneers 
That time will not allow us to forget now 
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo 
And the king of all, Sir Duke 
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out 
There's no way the band could lose 
You can feel it all over 
You can feel it all over people 
You can feel it all over 
You can feel it all over people 
You can feel it all over 
You can feel it all over people 
You can feel it all over

You can feel it all over people 
You can feel it all over 
You can feel it all over people 
You can feel it all over

I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you 
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you 
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in 
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in 
Oh, my love 
A thousand kisses from you is never too much 
I just don't wanna stop 
Oh, my love 
A million days in your arms is never too much 
I just don't wanna stop 
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started 
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken hearted 
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin' 
Opened the door up and to my surprise, there you were standin' 
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar 
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler 
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I'm winnin' 
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginnin'

I belong to you 
Girl, I'm here for you 
All those times at night when you just hurt me 
And just ran out with that other fella 
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care 
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you? 
I'm here for you 
I'm not out to go out there and cheat at night (maybe I'll forgive you) 
Just like you did baby, but that's alright 
I love you anyway (maybe you will try) 
And I'm still going to be here for you until my dying day, baby 
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (we should be happy together forever) 
'Cause you just won't come back to me, will you? (You and I) 
Just come back to me 
Yes baby, my heart is lonely (lonely, lonely) 
My heart hurts baby, yes, I feel pain too (lonely, lonely) 
Baby, please 
This time instead just come to my bed 
And baby just don't let me, don't let go 
Although we've come 
To the end of the road 
Still I can't let go 
It's unnatural 
You belong to me 
I belong to you 
Come to the end of the road 
Still I can't let go 
It's unnatural 
You belong to me 
I belong to you 
Although we've come 
To the end of the road 
Still I can't let go 
It's unnatural 
You belong to me 
I belong to you 
Come to the end of the road 
Still I can't let go 
It's unnatural 
You belong to me 
I belong to you"
TLC,Waterfalls,1994,soul,"A lonely mother gazin' out of the window 
Staring at her son that she just can't touch 
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much 
But all the praying just ain't helping at all 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble 
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how 
Another body layin' cold in the gutter, listen to me 
Don't go chasin' waterfalls 
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to 
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all 
But I think you're moving too fast 
Little precious has a natural obsession 
For temptation but he just can't see 
She gives him loving that his body can't handle 
But all he can say is, ""baby, it's good to me"" 
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror 
But he doesn't recognize his own face 
His health is fading and he doesn't know why 
Three letters took him to his final resting place, y'all don't hear me 
Don't go chasin' waterfalls 
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to 
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all 
But I think you're moving too fast 
Ah, c'mon 
I seen a rainbow yesterday 
But too many storms have come and joined 
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray 
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray 
I pray, all ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days 
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo 
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew 
Clear and blue and unconditional 
Skies have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries 
My only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't cope 
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps them in the pourin' rain 
Who's to blame for tootin' 'caine into your own vein 
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain 
You claim the insane and ain't this day and time for fallin' 
Prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind 
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true 
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you 
Don't go chasin' waterfalls 
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to 
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all 
But I think you're moving too fast 
Oh, you're moving too fast 
Don't go chasin' waterfalls 
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to 
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all 
But I think you're moving too fast"
Usher,U Got It Bad,1997,soul,"Oh-oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
No-ooh 
When you feel it in your body you found somebody who 
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew 
Said you act like you're ready but you don't really know 
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go 
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha 
After all that this is what I found 
Nobody wants to be alone 
If you're touched by the words in this song 
Then maybe 
You got it, you got it bad 
When you're on the phone 
Hang up and you call right back (oh, you) 
You got it, you got it bad 
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track 
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
You don't wanna have fun 
It's all you think about 
You got it bad when you're out with someone 
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else 
You got it bad 
When you say that you love 'em 
And you really know 
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more 
Like my money, all my cars 
(You can have it all back) 
Flowers, cards, and candy 
(I do it just 'cause I'm-) 
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl 
I want you to know 
I really adore you 
All my people who know what's going on 
Look at your mate, help me sing my song 
Tell her, ""I'm your man, you're my girl 
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"" 
Ladies say, ""I'm you gIrl, you're my man 
Promise to love you the best I can"" 
See I've been there, done it, humped around 
After all that this is what I found 
Every one of ya'll are just like me 
It's too bad that you can't see 
That you got it bad, hey 
You got it, you got it bad 
When you're on the phone 
Hang up and you call right back 
You got it, you got it bad 
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track 
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
You don't wanna have fun 
It's all you think about (look at yourself) 
You got it bad when you're out with someone 
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else 
You got it bad 
You got it, you got it bad 
When you're on the phone 
Hang up and you call right back 
You got it, you got it bad 
And if you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track 
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
You don't wanna have fun 
It's all you think about 
You got it bad when you're out with someone 
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else"

Oh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, 
Come on and rock me, ooh, girl 
Hey, girl, long time no see 
Do you have a little time to spend with me 
I want to know what's been going on 
In your life, huh, talk to me, baby 
Your hair, perfume you wear 
Brings back memories, oh, of you and me 
You look so fine, you blow my mind 
All over again, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, 
So much has happened in my life 
Since we partied 
What about you 
Now I've got myself together 
And I know just what I want 
And right now I know that it's you, you 
Rock me tonight for old times sake 
Would you, baby, hey 
Roll with me tonight for old times sake 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, 
Ooh, girl, I'm gonna love you real good 
Come on let me do it now, you know I could 
I really miss the way you squeeze and moan 
And call out my name, woo, woo, woo, you can call me, baby 
I remember you love to take your time 
To get in the mood, ooh, ooh, ooh, yes, you can call me, baby 
I remember you love to take your time 
To get in the mood, ooh, ooh, ooh, yes, you do, yeah 
But once you're in the mood 
You like to go shake to the groove, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, you do, girl 
It's been so long since we've had 
A night together 
I miss you 
When I get through lovin' you, girl 
Fire and desire 
Will burn in you forever more, more 
Rock me tonight for old times sake 
Would you, baby, hey 
Roll with me tonight for old times sake 
Woo, woo, would you, would you, would you 
Rock me tonight for old times sake 
Sweet, baby, yeah 
Roll with me tonight for old times sake

And I know just what I want 
And right now, girl, it's you, you 
Rock me tonight for old times sake (Sake)

Roll, roll with me tonight for old times sake 
Feels so good, feels so right

I want to feel you rock with a lot of lovin' 
The way I used to do, girl 
Do you remember 
I want to rock and roll with you, baby 
Come on, hey

Sweet thing, yeah"""
James Ingram,Just Once,1981,soul,"I did my best 
But I guess my best wasn't good enough 
Cause here we are 
Back where we were before 
Seems nothin' ever changes 
We're back to being strangers 
Wondering if we ought to stay 
Or head on out the door 
Just once 
Can we figure out what we keep doin' wrong 
Why we never last for very long 
What are we doin' wrong? 
Just once 
Can we find a way to finally make it right 
Make the magic last for more than just one night 
We could just get to it 
I know we could break through it 
Hmm hmm 
I gave my all 
But I think my all may have been too much 
Cause Lord knows we're not gettin' anywhere 
Seems we're always blowin' 
Whatever we've got goin' 
And it seems at times with all we've got 
We haven't got a prayer... 
Just once 
Can we figure out what we keep doin' wrong 
Why the good times never last for long 
Where are we goin' wrong? 
Just once 
Can we find a way to finally make it right 
Make the magic last for more than just one night 
I know we could break through it 
If we could just get to it 
Just once 
I want to understand... 
Why it always comes back to goodbye 
Why can't we get ourselves in hand 
And admit to one another 
We're no good without each other 
Take the best and make it better 
Find a way to stay together 
Just once... 
Can we find a way to finally make it right 
Whoa 
Make the magic last for more than just one night 
I know we could break through it 
If we could just get to it 
Just Once... 
Whoa, oh 
We can get to it... 
Just Once..."
Siedah Garrett,Ain't Nobody,1983,soul,"Captured effortlessly 
That's the way it was 
Happened so naturally 
Did not know it was love 
The next thing I felt was you 
Holdin' me close 
What was I gonna do? 
I let myself go 
And now we're flyin' through the stars 
I hope this night will last forever 
I've been waitin' for you 
It's been so long 
I knew just what I would do 
When I heard your song 
You filled my heart with a kiss 
You gave me freedom 
You knew I could not resist 
I needed someone 
And now we're flyin' through the stars 
I hope this night will last forever 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Ain't nobody (nobody) 
Loves me better (loves me better) 
Makes me happy 
Makes me feel this way (nobody) 
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody) 
Loves me better, than you 
I wait for night time to come 
To bring you to me 
I can't believe I'm the one 
I was so lonely 
I feel like no one could feel 
I must be dreamin' 
I want this dream to be real 
I need this feelin' 
I make my wish upon a star 
And hope this night will last forever 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody) 
Loves me better 
Makes me happy 
Makes me feel this way (nobody, baby) 
Ain't nobody (nobody, baby) 
Loves me better (nobody makes me feel) 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better, than you 
At first you put your arms around me 
Then you put your charms around me 
I can't resist this sweet surrender 
Oh, my nights are warm and tender 
We stare into each other's eyes 
And what we see is no surprise 
Got a feelin' most would treasure 
And a love so deep we cannot measure 
Ain't nobody (nobody) 
Loves me better 
Makes me happy 
Makes me feel this way 
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody) 
Loves me better (nobody) 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better (nobody, baby) 
Ain't nobody (nobody, baby) 
Loves me better 
Makes me happy 
Makes me feel this way 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better (nobody) 
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody) 
Loves me better (ain't nobody) 
Makes me happy 
Makes me feel this way (nobody, baby) 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better (ain't nobody) 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody (nobody, baby) 
Loves me better (ain't nobody, baby) 
Makes me happy (ain't nobody, baby) 
Makes me feel this way (ain't nobody) 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better 
Ain't nobody 
Loves me better (makes me feel this way) 
Makes me happy 
Makes me feel this way"
